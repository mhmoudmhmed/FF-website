                When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or “UDID”).
                
                We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or services.
                
                We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.
                
                SECURITY
                
                Friendly Foodies is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized or unlawful access, use, or disclosure and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, such Personal Information.
                
                Friendly Foodies has implemented industry-standard electronic means of protecting your Personal Information. We store Personal Information behind a computer firewall, a barrier designed to prevent outsiders from accessing our servers, and we have implemented technology to detect intrusions. We also require you to enter a password to access your account information. In addition, Friendly Foodies protects your Personal Information from unauthorized physical access by storing your Personal Information in a controlled facility.
                
                Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Friendly Foodies limits access to Personal Information in electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in Friendly Foodies’s organization who have a business need for such access. Lastly, we conduct periodic internal audits and vulnerability scans to ensure compliance with these security measures and generate security incident logs that track Information useful in screening for attempted abuse of or unauthorized access to your Personal Information.
                
                Even though Friendly Foodies has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Information is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that Friendly Foodies cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at contact@FriendlyFoodies.com.
